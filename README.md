# SynapNex™

>Device connecting the dots between 'synapses', 'nexus' and the device's functions.

![SynapNex cover](https://github.com/tinegachris/SynapNex-IoT-Controller/assets/72353423/ba9811f2-902a-4f77-8a2d-db21926e63ed)

## Overview

• It connects to various sensors and actuators using different communication protocols. This allows it to monitor data from sensors and control the state of actuators.

• Aggregates data from multiple sensors and performs computations or logic based on that data. For example, it can detect patterns, trigger alerts, or activate actuators based on sensor readings.

• Provides a cloud connection to send sensor data to the cloud and receive commands from the cloud. This allows remote monitoring and control of the IoT system.

• Implements a rules engine that allows users to define "if this, then that" rules to automate actions. For example, "If the temperature exceeds 30 °C, then turn on the fan".

• It can be implemented using a microcontroller or single-board computer at its core. It runs firmware to handle communication protocols, data aggregation logic, and a rules engine.

• It often has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other wireless radios to connect to the cloud and local devices, respectively. It may also have Ethernet, USB, and other interfaces.

• Provides a software API that apps and services can use to send commands and subscribe to data from the IoT controller. This acts as the interface for the IoT system.
